I am currently enrolled as a Junior(Pre-Final Year) in the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur and pursuing an undergraduate degree. I am majoring in Computer Science Engineering. I am interested in the Web Development field , ML & AI and DSA in C++ and Java and I am seeking exciting opportunities related to the same.

I am always curious about things and enjoy learning. I like to fix problems and fix errors. I am a detail oriented person, I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity.

I believe that the skills that I have acquired from the dynamic environment and competitive university life define me and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them at any opportunity that I receive.
